# Welcome to EEA Community Projects!

EEA Community Projects, an [OASIS Managed Open Project](https://www.oasis-open.org/managed-open-projects/), exists to provide a neutral forum for diverse stakeholders to create high-quality specifications that facilitate Ethereum’s longevity, interoperability, and ease of integration. The EEA Community Projects intend to develop clear, open standards, high-quality documentation, and shared test suites that facilitate new features and enhancements to the Ethereum protocol.

For more information on the goals of this effort, see our [project charter](https://github.com/eea-oasis/managed-open-project/blob/main/PROJECT_CHARTER.md).
